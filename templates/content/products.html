	  <h3>Comprehensive Circulation Control Returns to the Library</h3>
	  <p>
      Circulation services are fundamental, immemorial responsibilities of a librarian. Lending, 
      monitoring, and collecting statistics on the use of library materials are paramount in 
      collection management. As scholarly resources migrate from print to digital, librarians 
      cede more and more of their circulation responsibilities to publishers. The AUDITOR returns 
      control to the library â€“ saving time and money.

    <strong class="block">
      E-resources should be verified locally and their usage logged comprehensively. Availability 
      should be monitored passively in real time.

		  <h3>Holdings Verification</h3>
  		<strong>Access Checking &amp; Link Fault Detection</strong>
      <p>
        Holdings verification usually involves the systematic crawling of an entire catalog. This
        process artificially inflates usage, which weakens the ability to negotiate by decreasing
        cost per download.
      </p>
      <h4>Passive, Local Observation</h4>
      <p>
        The AUDITOR observes genuine activity as it occurs yielding no unnatural usage inflation. 
        Inaccessibility that is isolated to sub-networks is quickly identified.
      </p>
		  <h4>Comprehensive, Perpetual Inspection</h4>
      <p>
		    The AUDITOR is truly comprehensive. There is no statistical sampling and the verification 
		    is consistent and continual.
      </p>
		  <h4>Real-time Holdings Inference</h4>
      <p>
		    Sophisticated click-stream analysis infers library holdings in real-time. Unexpected access 
		    denials are detected immediately.

      <h3>Usage Logging</h3>
  		<strong>Comprehensive, Granular, and Local</strong>
  		<p>
  		  Currently, less than half of all e-resources offer standardized reports and a third offer 
  		  no reports at all. The reporting that is available consumes a great deal of time delivering 
  		  only general statistics when more granular reporting is needed.
      </p>
      <h4>Exhaustive, Detailed Data</h4>
      <p>
        The AUDITOR does not require usage data from publishers. It logs usage at the article level 
        and in much more detail.
      </p>
      <h4>Real-time Consolidation</h4>
      <p>
        Rather than waiting weeks, usage can be reviewed within minutes.
      </p>
      <h4>Internal Distribution &amp; Local Archival</h5>
      <p>
        Internal IP addresses allow usage to be attributed departmentally. The AUDITOR is its own 
        local archive. All usage in full detail is always available.

      <h3>Availability Monitoring</h3>
      <strong>Passive, Comparative Analysis</strong>
      <p>
        E-resources are not always available and their performance can vary dramatically. As with 
        holdings verification, monitoring e-resources by systematically requesting content weakens 
        the ability to negotiate by artificially inflating usage. Outages are difficult to diagnose, 
        consuming valuable resources when they occur.
      </p> 
      <h4>Passive, Continuous Observation</h4>
      <p>
        The AUDITOR observes genuine activity as it occurs yielding no unnatural usage inflation. 
        Every request is analyzed.
      </p>
      <h4>Comparative Troubleshooting</h4>
      <p>
        Error reports from an affected institution are anonymously combined with those from others 
        to immediately determine if the issue is localized or widespread. All affected institutions 
        will be promptly notified of the nature of the outage.
